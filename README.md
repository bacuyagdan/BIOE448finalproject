This repository contains the software, written in Arduino IDE, for LePoookie, a pedometer that tracks steps taken and calories burned by the user.
LePoookie tracks the steps taken by a user using an accelerometer. A push button circuit allows allows the user to select their height range and weight range. 
This biological data is required for LePoookie to calculate the calories burned by the user as they are taking steps. This conversion is performed based on 2024 Metabolic Equivalents of Tasks (MET) walking data.
LePoookie also feautures a reset swtich, allowing the user to reset the steps and calorie counters to zero.
LePoookie also utilizes BLE Bluetooth technology to allow the user to retrieve the steps taken and calories burned information via a smartphone app such as LightBlue.
LePoookie was made to encapsulate the learned knowledge in the BIOE 448 Microcontrollers course at Rice University taught by Dr. James Long in the spring of 2025.
Daniel Bacuyag and Brian Bishara are the creators of LePoookie, with hardware provided by Dr. James Long.
Commits are presented in this repository to outline updates to the Arduino program as they were created.

We would like to thank Dr. James Long for his support in BIOE 448 Microcontrollers as well as throughout our undergraduate careers at Rice University and wish him well on his upcoming position at University of Colorado at Boulder.
